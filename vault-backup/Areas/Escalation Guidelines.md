# Escalation Guidelines

> Source: Confluence OP space. By Wiebe Konter, Sep 2022.

## Basic Rules
1. If something isn't possible, say what IS possible
2. If you don't have the answer, tell them you'll get back to them (buy time to consult)
3. Never discuss without all facts on the table
4. Contract/T&C talk is always LAST resort
5. Always CALL for escalations — email sounds 3x harsher. Confirm by email after.
6. Acknowledge their viewpoint before stating ours

## Data Not Complete (Customer Side)
- Sales team tells customers throughput = 1 week. Reality: multiple sessions over time.
- No implementation fee — monthly fee starts after integration complete
- If data completion > 3 months → introduce coupling fee (50% of normal fee)
- Contract period starts AFTER implementation done + onboarding set

## Integration Issues
- Confirm latest start date in first integration call
- Schedule check-in tasks
- If can't meet deadline + won't pay full → integration fee (50%) — frame as "gift from Optiply"
- Can give away 1 month for customer satisfaction

## Something Sold Differently (Claim)
1. Talk to customer, assume good faith. Offer alternative solution.
2. If obstacle remains → talk to Partnership Manager
3. If still unclear → 10-min meeting: customer + PM + CSM
4. Always make the problem smaller. Cooperate, don't argue.

## Escalation Beyond Repair
1. Prefer to get started. Reference what was agreed upon.
2. If they accept partial fault but won't honor contract → offer 30% discount for re-start
3. Increase: 50% → 70% → 100% write-down
4. If threats (bad reviews, legal) → "we won't let this become legal, but we don't think it's fair we're solely responsible. What would you suggest?"
5. Final: waive contract, ask them to think of us when ready

## Cancellation (CS)
1. Check official end-date, communicate it
2. Suggest making things work until then
3. If cancel early → remaining contract invoiced immediately (per T&C)
4. Transfer to admin if they insist

## Cancellation (Admin)
1. Confirm cancellation + invoice for full period by email
2. If won't pay → propose credit for restart (build up: 1/3/6/12 months)
3. If unacceptable → write off months (build up: 1/3/6/12)
4. Last resort: cancel in full

## FAQ
- "No costs since we didn't start?" → Already planned resources, marketing/sales costs incurred. Like plane tickets.
- Discount only for: (1) New customer investment to show value, (2) Significant revenue drop with proof
